                <p>
                I am a software and web developer with a passion for problem-solving, clean code, and innovative technology. My journey into development began with over 100 hours of self-driven study through The Odin Project, where I built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub while working full-time in the NHS. To further accelerate my transition, I enrolled in the AI-Driven Software Engineering bootcamp by Skills City, a full-time program covering React, Python, SQL, Django, APIs, AI/ML, and Cloud Computing.

                Prior to transitioning into my new line of work, I have a very STEM and healthcare related background which gives me a unique edge in software development. With a BSc (Hons) in Biomedical Science and a Postgraduate Diploma in Physician Associate Studies, I spent years in high-pressure medical environments, developing critical thinking, leadership, and adaptability. As a Lead Physician Associate, I managed teams across multiple sites, honing my ability to communicate complex ideas, collaborate effectively, and drive continuous improvementâ€”skills that can all be transferred into the world of tech.

                <br/>
                I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and a passionate individual always looking to develop my knowledge. I am looking forward to combining my established skills with my growing developer knowledge to create impactful software solutions.
